# Score Keeper for ping pong

A web application I made for our college's ping pong tournament helps keep count of scores. It's responsive to different devices, so you can use it on any device. No need to worry about scorekeeping â€“ my wizard has got you covered!

## Instructions to run the project

- fork the project
- use an extention like LiveServer to serve the webpage from build folder
